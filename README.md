I’m a passionate and eager beginner developer with a focus on **web development**, coding, and learning new technologies. Currently, I’m exploring **full-stack development**, **front-end design**, and building projects that push me to grow as a programmer.

As a **freelancer**, I love collaborating on projects that allow me to bring fresh ideas and solutions to life. I enjoy problem-solving and developing practical, **user-friendly applications**.
